      <p id="p1">
            Since I was a child I have always had an interest in computers, 
         using them as always come easy and have had an natural intuition about them. 
         I was the kid on the block who used to fix everyones computers. 
         Web development or programming was never something i dabbled in until I 
         attended my first year at George Brown for their Computer Repair Technican course. 
         My goal at that time was to work as a network administrator but after the first week of 
         classes I became hooked on web development.
      </p>

      <p id="p2">
            The instant gratification after a save and refresh had me hooked and the ability to google 
         any question and have 5 different answers that all work I was a full blown addict. 
         I am still a beginner but with the endless coding languages, frameworks, web available 
         and always advancing I know that I will never stop learning, advancing and gaining capabilities 
         as long as i'm alive.
      </p>

       <p id="p3">
            I believe I'll be an asset to your company inspite of my lack of experience because of my ability 
         for problem solving and obsessive nature to produce only the highest quality ****** and to never 
         leave anything unfinished. I hope after reviewing my website and all its features i will be clear the potential 
         and tenacious drive that I have amd will bring to the office every day through my attitude and work. I'm eager to 
         bring my skills and enthosiasm to your team. Please contact me to arrange an interview at your earliest convenience.
